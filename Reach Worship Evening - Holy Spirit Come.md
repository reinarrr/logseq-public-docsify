## Theme
	- Recognising, Receiving, and Responding to the Presence and Power of the Holy Spirit
- ## Part 1: The Spirit Upon Him
	- ### Scripture Anchor: Luke 4:18-19 / Isaiah 61:1-2
		- "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
	- ### Focus
		- Recognising the Holy Spirit at work in the life and ministry of Jesus. The Spirit is not a side element—He is central to Jesus’ mission. And for us to recognise that the Holy Spirit central to our lives.
	- ### Key Points
		- Jesus begins His public ministry by declaring the Spirit is upon Him.
		- The Holy Spirit is not optional in the life of the believer—it was essential even for Jesus.

		- The Holy Spirit is not just to be known—He is to be welcomed.
		- Saturation is about full immersion, not partial awareness.
		- Ask: Are we making room for the Spirit in every part of our lives?
